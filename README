To install locally run:

    * git clone git://github.com/wwitzel3/vim-config.git
    * cd vim-config
    * sh install.sh

** WARNING: This installer removes your current ~/.vimrc, ~/.vim, and ~/.ackrc
** WARNING: and replaces them with symlinks to the contents of vim-config.
** WARNING: The script is not nice about and makes no effort to backup anything.

( Thought it doesn't use -r or -f so it will only delete files or symlinks )
